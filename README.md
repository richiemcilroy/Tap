# Tap is a blazing fast, GPUI powered note-taking app.

### Ermâ€¦ why?
This is a [Cap](https://cap.so/) team internal hackathon project. We wanted to experiment with GPUI, so this is what I chose to build.

### How is it fast?
[**GPUI**](https://www.gpui.rs/) is a minimalist Rust UI layer that talks straight to `wgpu`, so every pixel is drawn by your graphics card instead of the CPU.

* ðŸ’¨ **Micro-latency redraws** â€” the GPUâ€™s thousands of cores handle text layout and rendering in parallel.  
* ðŸ”‹ **Lower battery / CPU burn**  
* ðŸª¶ **Tiny footprint** â€” a native Rust binary (a few MB) instead of a 200 MB Electron bundle.

_No hidden browser, no heavyweight framework. Just Rust, `wgpu`, and your GPU doing what it does best._
